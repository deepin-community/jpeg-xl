Description: JPEG XL Image Coding System - "JXL" (command line utility)
 The JPEG XL Image Coding System (ISO/IEC 18181) is a lossy and
 lossless image compression format. It has a rich feature set and is
 particularly optimized for responsive web environments, so that
 content renders well on a wide range of devices. Moreover, it includes
 several features that help transition from the legacy JPEG format.
